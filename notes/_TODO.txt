TODO LIST:
    note delay
    pitch slide - stop over/underflow of counters
    vibrato
        isn't working with arpeggios currently (freq overwritten by arpeggios in music_update_pitch_registers/music_calc_fnum)
        speed values are inconsistent with furnace?
        Should vibrato reset on new note?
    should banjo_sfx_stop's effect be postponed to banjo_update?
    optional Song/SFX looping
        when Song ends and all channels need muting, only mute non-Sfx tracks otherwise it'll cut off Sfx too when a song ends
        if an sfx is looping and the song stops and a new song starts, need to mute the channel that the sfx is on again
    convert remaining js scripts to python
    restore noise mode on sfx end in sn channel 3
    fixed pitch noise mode - keep track of noise mode when generating commands, if in fixed pitch mode then do (midi_note = midi_note % 12)
