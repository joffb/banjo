sn clock frequency is 3579545

fnum = 3579545 / (2 * 16 * freq)

fnum * 2 * 16 * freq = 3579545
freq = 3579545 / (fnum * 2 * 16)

lowest possible frequency:
freq = 3579545 / (1023 * 2 * 16)
freq = 109 hz
lowest in-tune note possible is therefore midi note A2 (110 hz)
midi note number 45
in furnace this is note A-0

furnace goes up to F-7
midi note F9 (11175.30 hz)
note number 125

80 total playable notes

maximum difference between consecutive fnums occurs in the lowest notes:

	from A2 to A#2
	A#2 freq = 116.54 hz
	fnum = 3579545 / (2 * 16 * 116.54)
	fnum = 3579545 / 3712
	fnum = 964

	A2 freq = 110.00 hz
	fnum = 3579545 / (2 * 16 * 110)
	fnum = 3579545 / 3520
	fnum = 1016

	difference = 52

calculating for upper range:

	D#9 fnum = 11
	E9 fnum = 11

	freq = 3579545 / (11 * 2 * 16)
	freq = 10169

	somewhere between D#9 (9956.06 hz) and E9 (10548.08 hz)

	not enough resolution between fnums at higher pitches

looking at accuracy:

	C8 (4186.01 hz)
	fnum = 27
	freq = 3579545 / (27 * 2 * 16)
	freq = 4142 hz

	B7 (3951.07 hz)
	fnum = 28
	freq = 3579545 / (28 * 2 * 16)
	freq = 3995 hz

	C7 (2093.00 hz)
	fnum = 53
	freq = 3579545 / (53 * 2 * 16)
	freq = 2110 hz

	C6 (1046.50 hz)
	fnum = 107
	freq = 3579545 / (107 * 2 * 16)
	freq = 1045 hz
