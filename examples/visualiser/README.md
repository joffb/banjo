# Visualiser example
This will play a song in the background (different songs depending on whether an FM chip is detected)

To build this you'll need to copy crt0_sms.rel, peep-rules.txt, SMSlib.h and SMSlib.lib from DevkitSMS into this folder (or add the folders containing them to the include path and library include paths in the build scripts)
